# WACL-internship-code

- In lcs_final_code_p1, I was mainly trying to explore and compare the low cost sensors (LCS) data and the reference data.
- "quant_lcs_hourly.csv" contains the LCS data, "quant_reference_hourly.csv" contains the reference data and "quant_instruments.csv" just links each instrument to the right company.
- I also check the accuracy of the sensors and how their RMSE varies with time.

- In lcs_final_code_p2, I try to correct the measurements of the LCS data using the "NO2_Diffusion_Tubes.xlsx" data
